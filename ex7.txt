Part 1: Setting Up a Hypervisor Cluster

Task 1: Set Up Hypervisor Hosts

- Install VMware ESXi on Virtual Machines:
    Install VMware ESXi (which is a hypervisor) on virtual machines (VMs) in VMware Workstation Pro 17. You can use two or more VMs for this.
    Download the VMware ESXi ISO from the VMware website and install it on each VM as the operating system.
- Steps to Install ESXi on VMs:
    Open VMware Workstation Pro 17 and create a new VM.
    When selecting the OS, choose Linux â†’ Other Linux 5.x kernel 64-bit (for ESXi compatibility).
    Mount the ESXi ISO and follow the installation prompts.
    Repeat this process for all VMs (e.g., ESXiHost1 and ESXiHost2).
- Configure Networking:
    Ensure that all your ESXi hosts are on the same network. You can create a custom virtual network in VMware Workstation for the VMs to communicate.
    Assign static IPs to each ESXi VM for easier management.
- Access ESXi Web Interface:
    Once the ESXi VMs are installed, access their web interfaces by opening a browser and entering the IP address of each host.
      http://<ESXiHost1_IP_Address>
      
Task 2: Configure Hypervisor Clustering

- Install vCenter Server: VMware vCenter Server is needed to manage multiple ESXi hosts as a cluster.
- Download the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) from VMware.
- Create a new VM in VMware Workstation and install the VCSA on it.
- Follow the installation prompts and configure the networking for vCenter.
- Add ESXi Hosts to vCenter:
    Open the vCenter web client from a browser:
      https://<vCenter_IP_Address>:5480
- Log in with the credentials you set during installation.
- Go to Hosts and Clusters in the vCenter interface.
- Add both ESXi hosts (ESXiHost1 and ESXiHost2) to vCenter.
- Click on Add Host, and enter the IP address, username, and password of each ESXi host.
- This will allow vCenter to manage the hypervisors.
- Create a Cluster in vCenter:
    Once both hosts are added, right-click on the Datacenter in vCenter and choose New Cluster.
    Enable features like DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler) and HA (High Availability).
    Add both ESXi hosts to the newly created cluster.
    
Part 2: Implement High Availability and Load Balancing

Task 1: Configure High Availability for VMs

- Enable High Availability (HA):
    In the vCenter web interface, go to your cluster and enable HA.
    HA ensures that if one ESXi host fails, the VMs running on it are automatically restarted on another host in the cluster.
    Steps to Enable HA:
      Right-click on the cluster and go to Settings.
      In the cluster settings, navigate to vSphere Availability and enable HA.
      Set the failover capacity, which defines how many host failures the cluster can tolerate.
      
Task 2: Implement Load Balancing

- Enable Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS):
    DRS dynamically balances the VM workloads across the ESXi hosts in the cluster based on resource usage.
    Go to your cluster in vCenter, right-click and choose Settings.
    Under vSphere DRS, enable DRS.
    Set it to fully automated mode for automatic load balancing, where VMs are migrated between hosts as needed to balance the load.
    
Part 3: Manage and Migrate Virtual Machines

Task 1: Migrate VMs Across Hypervisors

- Create Virtual Machines in ESXi Hosts:
    Use vCenter or the ESXi web interface to create several virtual machines (VMs) on the cluster.
- Perform Live Migration (vMotion):
    vMotion allows you to migrate running VMs from one ESXi host to another with no downtime.
- In the vCenter web interface, select a VM and choose Migrate.
- Follow the steps to migrate the VM to another ESXi host within the cluster.
- Live Migration Steps:
    Right-click on the VM.
    Select Migrate.
    Choose the destination host (another ESXi in the cluster) and complete the migration process.
