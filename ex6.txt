Exercise 6: Task Scheduling and Load Balancing in a Cloud Environment

Part 1: Task Scheduling

Task 1: Implement Task Scheduling with Cloud Services

- Open VMware Workstation Pro 17:
    Power on the VMs you plan to use (e.g., UbuntuSelcia and UbuntuClone).
- Configure Task Scheduling on Ubuntu VMs:
    We will use cron to schedule tasks, which is the Linux utility for task scheduling.
- Create a Task in Ubuntu VM:
    Create a script file using: nano script.sh
    Add: echo “Hello Selcia”
- Open the cron file using the command: crontab -e
- Add a scheduled task (for example, to run a script every 1 minute):
		*/1 * * * * ./script.sh
- Verify the Task:
    Check if the task is running by checking the output of the script or inspecting logs, if any. 
	    tail -f /var/log/syslog
     
Part 2: Load Balancing

- Install and Configure HAProxy on a Separate VM (Load Balancer):
- You can use a separate VM to act as the load balancer or install HAProxy on one of your VMs.
- Install HAProxy using the following command:
		sudo apt install haproxy -y
- Configure HAProxy:
    Open the HAProxy configuration file: sudo nano /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    Add the following configuration to set up load balancing among your VMs:
    		frontend http_front
          bind *:80
          default_backend http_back
        backend http_back
            balance roundrobin
            server vm1 <VM1_IP>:80 check
            server vm2 <VM2_IP>:80 check
            server vm3 <VM3_IP>:80 check
- Start HAProxy Service:
- After configuring HAProxy, restart the service to apply changes:
		sudo systemctl restart haproxy
    sudo systemctl enable haproxy
- Test the Load Balancer: http://<load_balancer_IP>

Part 3: Advanced Scheduling and Load Balancing (Optional)

Task 1: Implement Advanced Scheduling with Prioritization

- Prioritization in Task Scheduling (Cron):
    You can set priorities for tasks in Linux using nice and renice commands. Modify your cron jobs to execute scripts with priority:
	    */1 * * * * nice -n 10 .//script.sh
    In this case, nice -n 10 lowers the priority of the task. You can adjust the priority by changing the value between -20 (highest priority) and 19 (lowest priority).
