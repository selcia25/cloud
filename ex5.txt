Exercise 5: Virtual Instances and Server Consolidation with Fault Tolerance in a Cloud Environment

Part 1: Virtual Instances Management

Task 1: Create and Configure Virtual Instances

- Open VMware Workstation Pro 17:
- Start VMware Workstation and open your existing Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS VM.
- Clone Virtual Instances (VMs):
    Since you already have one Ubuntu VM, you can create additional VMs by cloning.
    Right-click on the existing Ubuntu VM and select Manage > Clone.
    In the cloning wizard, select Create a full clone to make identical copies of the VM.
    Clone as many VMs as you need (e.g., two or three additional VMs for the lab exercise).
- Power On the Cloned VMs:
    Power on the newly cloned VMs by right-clicking on each and selecting Power On.
    Once powered on, open the terminal in each VM.
- Install Apache Web Server on Each VM:
    For each VM, install Apache using the following commands: 
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install apache2 -y
- Verify Apache is running:
	    sudo systemctl status apache2
- You can modify the Apache default web page to make it unique for each instance:
	    sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html
- Configure Networking: ifconfig 

Task 2: Implement Basic Load Balancing

- Install and Configure HAProxy on a Separate VM (Load Balancer):
- You can use a separate VM to act as the load balancer or install HAProxy on one of your VMs.
- Install HAProxy using the following command:
      sudo apt install haproxy -y
- Configure HAProxy:
    Open the HAProxy configuration file: sudo nano /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    Add the following configuration to set up load balancing among your VMs:
		  frontend http_front
        bind *:80
        default_backend http_back
      backend http_back
          balance roundrobin
          server vm1 <VM1_IP>:80 check
          server vm2 <VM2_IP>:80 check
          server vm3 <VM3_IP>:80 check
- Start HAProxy Service:
    After configuring HAProxy, restart the service to apply changes:
		  sudo systemctl restart haproxy
      sudo systemctl enable haproxy
- Test the Load Balancer: http://<load_balancer_IP>
